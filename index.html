    <h4>("The rain of bullets eventually brought her down")</h4>
    <p>“Heroes and Villains’’ is a song by The Beach Boys that was released on July 31, 1967. The song was written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks. For <em>Smile</em>, sessions for the song took place from May 11, 1966 to March 2, 1967 (Badman, 2004; Slowinski and Boyd, 2011). When <em>Smile</em> was shelved, sessions to complete “Heroes and Villains’’ for the <em>Smiley Smile</em> album took place from June 12 to June 14, 1967 (Badman, 2004, p. 189).</p>
    <p>According to <em>The Smile Sessions</em> (2011) booklet that is included in the five disc box set, Slowinski and Boyd - who researched and organized the “Smile Sessionography” - state that the first tracking session for “Heroes And Villains” took place on May 11, 1966. This session was only an experiment and not a full-blown recording (Badman, 2004, p. 132). Despite documentation, the recording from this session (Master # 55999) is lost (Slowinski and Boyd, 2011). On October 20, 1966, Brian held the first genuine instrumental session for “Heroes And Villains”, in which he recorded the verse to the song (Badman, 2004, pp. 151 & 153). Also during this session, he recorded “Barnyard”. On October 27, 1966, an instrumental tracking session for “I’m in Great Shape” was recorded. Then on November 4, 1966, Brian demonstrated how he envisions “Heroes And Villains” to Van Dyke Parks (Badman, 2004, p. 156). During this time, “I’m in Great Shape” and “Barnyard” were included in the song “Heroes And Villains”. This demonstration is included on <em>The Smile Sessions</em> as “Heroes And Villains Piano Demo”. For the songs “I’m in Great Shape” and “Barnyard” in the reconstructed album, the lead vocals are taken from this piano demo (Slowinski and Boyd, 2011).</p>
    <p>In the 2004 book, <em>The Beach Boys: the definitive diary of America's greatest band: on stage and in the studio</em>, Badman states that in December 1966, Capitol Records was expecting the <em>Smile</em> album to be released on January 15 and the single “Heroes And Villains”/“Heroes And Villains Part II” to be released on January 13 (Badman, 2004, p. 165). With neither of them completed before that time, Brian continued to record more vocals from the Beach Boys for “Heroes And Villains” in January and February. Examples of vocal sessions that were recorded are, “Gee”, “Cantina”, “Children Were Raised”, “Whistling Bridge”, and “Bridge To Indians”. On March 2, 1967, Brian finally finished “Heroes And Villains”. However, after Smile was shelved in May, Badman states that the Beach Boys recorded a new vocal and re-recorded parts of the instrumental track. This included adding an organ onto the song. On June 14, “Heroes And Villains” was finally completed to Brian's satisfaction and it would be released as a single next month.</p>
